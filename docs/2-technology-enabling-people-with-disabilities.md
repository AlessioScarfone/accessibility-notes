# Technology enabling people with disabilities
There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. For instance, some may have disabilities from birth, an illness, disease, or accident, or they may develop impairments with age.

For example:
- **Age-related impairments:** Many people develop age-related impairments. While they share the same functional requirements as others with disabilities, sometimes there are significant differences in the use of assistive technologies, the level of computer skills, or in the use of the Web in general.
- **Multiple disabilities:** Some people have combinations of different kinds of disabilities, which may limit their approaches for interacting with the Web. For example, someone who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color.
- **Health conditions:** Some people have health conditions that may affect their stamina, dexterity, or concentration. For instance, some may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that could have an impact on their physical use of the computer or limit the duration or extent of their use of the Web.
- **Changing abilities:** Some people may be experiencing progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their use of the Web differently at different times. For example, some may need particular accessibility features on one day, and others or none on another day, depending on their condition.
- **Temporary impairments:** Some people may be experiencing temporary impairments such as those that may occur due to an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility features, and may be unaware of their needs.
- **Situational limitations:** Some people may be experiencing constraints due to their surrounding or due to other situational aspects. For example, they may be in a loud environment and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a screen, or they may not be able to afford some technologies.

> 1. **Function vision:** it refers to the ability to align and focus both eyes on the same point in 3-D space.
> 2. **Cognitive disabilities** is a term that refers to a broad range of conditions that include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, severe, persistent mental illness, brain injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
> 3. A **learning disability** is to do with the way someone's brain works. It makes it harder for someone to learn, understand or do things. is a reduced intellectual ability and difficulty with everyday activities

## Auditory
Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids. 

> Example of barriers are: Audio content (such as videos with voices and sounds) without captions or transcripts, Media players that not provide caption and not display controls, etc

To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely on:
- Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only content and audio tracks in multimedia;
- Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colors of captions;
- Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume);
- High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise.

> For some people with auditory disabilities, <u>**sign language is the primary language**</u>, and they may not read the written language as fluently. Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities know sign language.

## Cognitive, learning, and neurological
Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may affect any part of the nervous system and **impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information**. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person.

People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities use different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular needs.
For example, some people use text-to-speech software to hear the information while reading it visually or use captions to read the information while hearing it. Some people use tools that resize text and spacing or customize colors to assist reading. Others use grammar and spelling tools to support writing.
Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on:

- Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation;
- Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts;
- Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction;
- Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search;
- Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content;
- Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations;


## Physical
Physical disabilities (sometimes called “motor disabilities”) include weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs.

To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized hardware and software such as:

- Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse;
- Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing;
- On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing devices;
- Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other movements;
- Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction.

People with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. Providing large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, and error correction options for forms are important design aspects. Other important design aspects include providing visible indicators of the current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page headers or navigation bars. People with cognitive and visual disabilities share many of these requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> They may need more time to type, click, or carry out other interaction, and they may type single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes (“chording”) to activate commands.

## Speech
Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For example, the loudness or clarity of someone’s voice might be difficult to understand.

People with speech disabilities encounter **barriers with voice-based services**, such as automated web-based hotlines and web applications that are operated using voice commands. To use services that rely on voice, people with speech disabilities need alternative modes of interaction such as a text-based chat to interact with hotline representatives and keyboard commands to operate web applications. Also, websites that provide telephone numbers as the only means of communicating with an organization pose barriers for people with speech disabilities. Alternative means of communication include e-mail and feedback forms.

## Visual
Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes (“low vision”) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes (“blindness”). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors (“color blindness”), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity.

People with visual disabilities typically rely on **changing the presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their particular needs**. For example by:

- Enlarging or reducing text size and images;
- Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing;
- Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content;
- Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia;
- Reading text using refreshable Braille.

For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that the presentation of web content is independent of its underlying structure and that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be processed and presented in different ways by web browsers and assistive technologies.


## Tools and Techniques
People with disabilities access and navigate the Web in different ways, depending on their individual needs and preferences. Sometimes people configure standard software and hardware according to their needs, and sometimes people use specialized software and hardware that help them perform certain tasks.

Some common approaches for interacting with the Web include:
- **Assistive Technologies:** software and hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web (ex: screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, etc)
- **Adaptive Strategies:**  techniques that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the Web (ex: ncreasing text size, reducing mouse speed, and turning on captions, etc)

One type of assistive technology or adaptive strategy is not necessarily neatly mapped to just one type of disability and they can be used by everyone regardless of ability. 
In the digital world the most prevalent assistive technology is the keyboard. Many assistive technology that may have originated as a tool for people with disabilities have become mainstream, for example: keyboard, oom, closed captions (subtitles) and voice recognition in phone, card and home device.

These tools and strategies are used to improve:
- **Perception:**  People perceive content through different senses depending on their needs and preferences (auditory; tactile; visual)
- **Presentation distinguishing and understanding:** People adjust the presentation of content to make it easier to distinguish and understand.
- **Input typing, writing, and clicking:** People use different approaches to enter text and activate commands. (some people do not use a mouse, some not use a keyboard or use them in different ways; some use alternative hardware or software)
- **Interaction navigating and finding:** People navigate and find content using different strategies and approaches depending on their preferences, skills, and abilities.
