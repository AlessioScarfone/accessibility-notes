When a user is unable to complete their business, this may result in: frustrations, anxiety, waste of their time, loss of privacy and security, loss of reputation and revenue for the organization and possible litigation for organiziation

> Digital accessibility si best udenrstood as the electronic curb-cut, the digital equivalent of the whellechair ramp for sidewalks. Just as curb-cuts benefit people with disabilities as well as parents with strollers, travelers with suitcases, and workers with deliveries, digital accessibility benefits everyone.

> Public use of the web is more than 25 years old. It is no longer a novelty but an integrated, critical tool of modern life. As smart businesses integrate accessible design into their development and procurement processes, they understand the need for equal access by all people. The legal risks of ignoring accessibility are significant, and the benefits have also been demonstrated by leaders like Apple, Barclays, NPR, IBM, Microsoft and hundreds more. Business leaders and the advocates who influence them can have tremendous social impact and a healthy return on investment as they follow a roadmap that leads to equal access. More than one billion people with disabilities in the world are eager to engage with you as customers, clients, partners, employees, and equal participants in civic and social activities.

## Drive Innovation
Integrating accessibility removes architectural, digital, and social barriers that can get in the way of innovation. Accessible design is by its nature flexible, allowing content to faithfully render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems. In physical environments, everyone takes advantage of lower curbs, automatic door openers, ramps, and other features provided for disability access. On the web, accessibility features become options that are also often used more widely.


## Enhance Your Brand
Businesses need to protect and enhance their brands. A clear commitment to accessibility can demonstrate that a business has a genuine sense of **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**. As businesses understand and act on the diverse needs of their stakeholders and make the commitment to sustainable, inclusive marketing and employment practices, they can achieve a range of benefits. Potential outcomes for CSR programs include enhanced brand image and reputation, increased sales and customer loyalty, improved workforce diversity and many other benefits. Employing people with disabilities is an essential aspect of creating a diverse workforce. To be successful, the technology that employees use, including websites and applications, must be accessible.


## Increase Market Reach
The market of people with disabilities is large and growing as the global population ages. The global estimate of the disability market is nearly $7 trillion.

- As the population ages, many more acquire disability and yet do not identify as a “person with a disability”
- In countries with life expectancies of over 70 years of age, people spend 11.5 percent of their lifespan living with a disability.<br/>[World Population Chart for Countries and Continents. Disabled World (2017)](https://www.disabled-world.com/calculators-charts/wpc.php)

Accessible design considerations often lead to improvements in general customer experience and loyalty. For customers with disabilities, such improvements are essential for equal access. However, accessibility provides options that are useful to all customers in various situations. 


## Minimize Legal Risk
Consideration of the cost and risk of inaction is a critical aspect of any business case. As web use is woven into modern life all over the world, governments and regulators began to mandate laws and policies that strengthen the rights of people with disabilities to participate in online digital information and services, therefore the legal landscape is rapidly changing in favor of equal access. Over time, the legal risk increased with the adoption of more specific laws and policies in countries throughout the world.

**With legal risks increasing, smart businesses – particularly those with global activities – are creating accessibility policies and programs to mitigate risk to protect both their assets and their reputations.**

> **The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability** (UNCRPD, 2006)- Article 9
> 
> "People with disabilities have the right to access all aspects of society on an equal basis with others including the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services provided to the public."

The **UNCRPD** was adopted in December 2006 and entered into force in 2008. It has been signed by 164 country and ratified by 180 countries.  The UNCRPD is the first legally binding international instrument to protect the rights of people with disabilities. It is a comprehensive human rights treaty that covers civil and political rights, accessibility, participation in political and public life, education, health, employment, and more. The UNCRPD is a key driver for the adoption of accessibility laws and policies around the world. Most countries have adopted their own method for governing accessibility internally. For some countries, the requirement only apply to government organizations, and in others, it applies to both public and private organizations. However most require compliance with WCAG 2.0 or 2.1.

The European Union currently has the **Web Accessibility Directive and the European Accessibility Act**. which use WCAG 2.1.
