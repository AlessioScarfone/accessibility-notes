# Robust

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Compatible

Robust content is compatible with different browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents. Examples of how this can be achieved include:

- Ensuring markup can be reliably interpreted, for instance by ensuring it is valid.
- Providing a name, role, and value for non-standard user interface components.

Meeting this requirement helps maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. In particular, it enables assistive technologies to process the content reliably, and to present or to operate it in different ways. This includes non-standard (scripted) buttons, input fields, and other controls.
