# Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion

**Accessibility, usability, and inclusion** are closely related aspects in creating a web that works for everyone. Their goals, approaches, and guidelines overlap significantly. It is most effective to address them together when designing and developing websites and applications.

- **Accessibility:** addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers.
- **Usability:** is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Usability includes user experience design. This may include general aspects that impact everyone and do not disproportionally impact people with disabilities. Usability practice and research often does not sufficiently address the needs of people with disabilities.
- **Inclusion:** is about diversity, and ensuring involvement of everyone to the greatest extent possible. In some regions this is also referred to as universal design and design for all. It addresses a broad range of issues including: accessibility for people with disabilities, access to and quality of hardware, software, and Internet connectivity, education, economic situation, geographic location, age, language, etc..

> Accessibility primarily focuses on people with disabilities. Many accessibility requirements improve usability for everyone, especially in limiting situations.
> Several accessibility requirements also benefit people and situations that are a focus of inclusive design. For example: it help people with low literacy or not fluent in the language, new users, old users, people with low bandwidth, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disability is caused by mismatch between the design and the person**
> 
> Many people think of disability as a characteristic of a person. For example a person who is blind or a person who uses a wheelchair. However, it's not about a person's abilities or impairments, it's about the design. For example, in a world where all book are written in braille, the person who does not know braille is disadvantaged.
> **Bad design is disabling**. When designs (and code) provide the flexibility to meet all users' needs, then they are enabling. 
> This is also called **"social model" of disability**.

> ***Accessibility is essential for some, useful for all***
