# Essential components of accessibility

Standards and guidelines as well as assistive technologies and adaptive strategies are essential to making web content accessible.The ingredients to make digital content accessible to people are:
- **Technoogy** including assistive technology, web authoring and evaluation tools.
- **Standards and guidelines**, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), [ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/) e [UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/).
- **People** including not just people with disabilities, but everyone involved in creating products and services (users; developers; authoring)

## Technology

As well as **assistive technology**, **web authoring** and **evaluation tools** are essential to make content accessible to people with disabilities.

**Authoring tools** enables us to create and publish content on the Web (text editors; web application frameworks; web design and prototypes tools; etc.). They are not restricted to web developers and designers but also content creator, social media manager, etc. For example all the people that use: content managemente systems (CMS), word processing tools (Microsoft word, Google Docs, etc.), presentation tools (PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.), Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), etc. Software providers who create these tools have a responsibility to make them not only accessible to use but also support the generation of accessibile content. As content creators we then have a responsibility to generate accessible content (for example: adding alternative text to images posted on twitter)

**Evaluation tools** are used by web developers, designers, and quality assurance testers to test websites and application for accessibility. They are software programs or online services that help determine if web content meets the guidelines. Tools typically crawl through code to assess whether the code is written correctly and can be understood by browsers and assistive technology. They can only test some of the accessibility requirements that do not need human intervention (for example: alternative text for images, form labels, etc.). Therefore, testing done by a human is essential to ensure an accessible user experience.

> **No automated evaluation tool can tell you if your site is one hundred percent accessible, or even compliant.** Only using a combination of accessibility evaluation tools and manual testing can tell you how accessible and compliant your site is.

## Standards and technical guidelines
In order to understand how to author and evaluate accessible content, we need to follow guidelines. There are three sets of accessible guidelines produced by the **Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)**:

- **[Web content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)**: defines requirements on how to make Web content such as text, images, multimedia, etc. accessible to people with disabilities. It is the most well known and widely used set of guidelines. It is also the most technical and is aimed at web developers and designers.
- **[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)**: defines requirements on how to make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content. It also defines requirements how authors can create accessible web content and conform to WCAG.
- **[User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)**: provides guidance on how to make user agents accessible to poeple with disabilities. User agents include web browsers, browser extension, media players, readers.


These accessibility guidelines are based on the fundamental technical specifications of the web, and are developed in coordination with all W3C technical specifications (HTML, CSS, SVG etc.). W3C also develops technical specifications that directly address accessibility, including:
- **[ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications(WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/)**:  which defines a way to make web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

## People

Key to bringing technology and guidelines together to create accessible user expericences are people. Everybody involved in the software development life cycle (SDLC) has a role to play:
- **product owners, and organization**, have a resposibility to mandate and resource teams to create accessible products;
- **developers** are responsible for authoring content that follows technology specification and accessibility guidelines;
- **user experience professionals and designers** are responsible for creating accessible layouts, images, presentations, features and user journeys as well as carrying our user research and usability testing with people with disabilities;
- **content editors** are responsible for content strategy, text, equivalent alternatives for non-text contents and other general text elements presented in the page;
- **quality assurance and testers** are resposible for checking for compliance with standards and guidelines using a combination of evaluation tools, assistive technologies and manual testing.
