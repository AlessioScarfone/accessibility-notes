# Hearing and speech disabilities

It is easy to assume that people with heading and speech loss o not expericence any barriers when using the Web given it is mostrly a visual medium. However, there are a number of challenges that can prevent people from accessing information and interacting with the web. For exaple **Video** is an obvious challenge.

To support this people, videos shoud have Closed Captions, subtitles and/or transcripts:
- **Closed Captions:** for the same language as the spone audio.
- **Subtitle:** for spoen audio **translated** into another language.
- **Transcripts** are a text vision of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content.
- **Sign language** uses hand and arm movements, facial expressions and body positions to convey meaning.

> [!NOTE] 
> In some regions, subtitles are used for both the same languange as the audio and for the translation.


## Closed Captions
Audio content without captions or transcripts are completely inaccessible to anyone with significant hearing loss. **Closed captions must be in sync with the audio.** People who lip read may be following the content by both watching people speak as well as reading.

Some video platforms provide automatic caption functionality that can be a great help but curretly not reliable for use by people with disabilities, especially when speakers have accents and for many language with less support for speech recognition.

The existente of caption is not enough. It is important that they are accurate, provide the same information as the audio and are easy to read with good contrast and decent size.

## Media Players
Media Players have a role to play. They should provide a way to turn on and off captions and subtitles. Ideally, the button are grouped togheter with other controls like Play/Pouse, Volume, etc. Having button hidden within settings make it hard to find. They should also provide a way to change the size and color of the captions and subtitles.

## Text
For many people who are deaf, **sign language is their first language, so also closed caption or written text may not be easy to read**. Some users may find it easier to watch a video with sign language alternatives over closed captions. For page with a lot of text, it can be helpful a good use of images, icons and color to reinforce meaning. 

## Speech disabilities

People may have limited or no speech for number of reason:
- **Mutism:** inability to speak, may occurs due to anxiety, brain injury, or inability to hear and learn speech.
- **Speech impediments:** such as struttering or Tourette syndrome.
- **Degenerative disease:** such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, etc.
- **Being deaf or hard of hearing** may also affect speech.
- **Temporary illness** such as coughts or treatment such as chemo that can affect throat and speech.
- **Situational impairments** such as being in a noisy environment or a quiet enviroment where it is not possible to be noisy.

It is easy to assume that with this kind of disabilities, people don't encounter challenges on the Web given that Web is thought of as a visual medium. However, there are a number of challenges that can prevent people from accessing information and interacting with the Web. For example: **voice-based** service such as in home devices, like Alexa or Google Home, or voice control on mobile such as Siri, Cortana, etc. They are a good example of an accessibile enhancement but one that should not be relied on alone. **It is important to include multiple way to do a task rather the limit it to just one way.**
