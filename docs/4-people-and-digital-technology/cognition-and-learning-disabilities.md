# Cognition and learning disabilities
Cognition and learning is as broad as it is varied and can affect different people in very different ways. It covers neurologica, behavioral, mental health disorder, and aging it can affect how well people see, hear, move, speak, and understand information. Because of this, they may encounter challenges that affect people with visual, physical, hearing and speech disabilities.

> It is important to remember that **cognitive and learning disabilities are not always visible**. For example: dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, autism, etc.

Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts can be difficult to understand and use for many people. When a **navigation system**\ is vast and complex, finding the right link may become problematic expecially for people with dexterity issues. **Complex layouts** presents the same issue: difficulty in finding the content a user is looking for. If site is responsibe, it's common for some user to euther resize the window to smaller mobile size or zoom to trigger a responsive layout. In this way, the content is easier to read and navigate. Content presented in a single column layout making it easier to navigate for some, but remember that what works for some won't work for all, so this is not a preferred strategy for someone who finds scrolling distracting. This is why **sites must be flexible so people have a choice**

## Flexible design
Reading text can be difficult for some people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It can be too small, too big, the line height too narros, the style hard to read or the color difficult to see. A key strategy for people with cognitive and learning disabilities is to **adapt the page to suit their needs using browser controls or custom style sheets**. This allow people to adjust font styles, font, colors, margins, etc. to suit their needs. This is possible as long as the site has been coded in such a way as to allow people to make such customizaton. (For example: using relative units for font size, line height, margins, etc. and not using fixed units such as pixels. )

## Text
Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand can prevent users from understanding content and context. For example: **jargon**, **acronyms**, **slang**, **metaphors** can be difficult to understand for some people. Walls of text can also be equally difficult. Ideally, **long text** should be broken down into smaller chunks with headings, lists, images, etc. to help users understand the content and context.

## Images
Images can be both helpful or distracting, depending on how they are used. **Icons need to be clearly recognizable and consistent** with what people will recognize from around the Web. For some, icon can always be difficult to undestand, so **presenting a visible text label** next to an icon can help with understanting. However, text within images 
could be hard for users to understand, especially if there are multiple images of text on the page. 

When used in a balanced way, images can enhance the undestaning of a page by providing a secondary way of conveying information already contained in the text and reinforcing meaning.

## Movement and animation

Moving, blinking, or flickering content, video or audio that autoplays and connot be turned off can be distracting for users. Content like this is designed to grab the users attention, to promote product and push adverts. They may act as annoyance for some but they can be a huge challenge for others. **Movement and animation should be avoided, or come to a rest after short time**. Alternatively, **they must provide a button to stop animation or media.**


## Browser settings and customization

One of the most frequently used daptive strategies is customizing platform and browser settings. Each platform/browser is different but all offer similar features such as:
- **Increase font size**
- **Zoom**
- **Use high contrast mode**

There are also a number of accessibility extensions that can be added to browsers and provide a number of features to help navigation. Some users may use customization tools to adapt content to their needs. These can do similar things to browser settings but might give people more choise.
