# Implement and Maintain

> From: [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/)

To implement and maintain your achievement there are 5 aspect to check:
- **Accessibility is a shared responsibility:** which accessibility aspects to assign to different role.
- **Skills need to be build:** and maintained as the environment and staff change.
- **Products need to be created accessibility:** and future enhancements need to also meet your organization's commitments.
- **Change need to be monitored:** platform changes, technology changes, standard and law changes, and policy and skills need to be kept up to date.
- **Stakeholder engagement:** this needs to continue with both internal and external stakeholders

## Accessibility and roles

Let's consider the common roles in a sustainable multidisciplinary team that has the responsibility to design, build, operate and interate digital services, led by a product manager with decision-making responsibility. The team and their responsibilities for accessibility, would look like:
- **product manager (product owner):** overall responsibility;
- **user researcher:** ensuring people with disability are included;
- **interaction designer:** considers the different ways people access the web;
- **graphic designer:** color and contrast choices;
- **content author/designer:** content structure and readability;
- **developer:** semantic coding;
- **QA/tester:** checks all good before release.

> [!Note]
> In some teams, one person might have two or more roles.


## Build and maintain skills
Develop the accessibility skills of everyone involved, including designers, developers, content creators, and managers. This includes providing training for existing staff, as well as including accessibility skills in staff recruitment criteria. Examples of training include:

- Introductions to accessibility for everyone
- How accessibility benefits your business for management and project managers
- Accessible visual design for designers and marketing
- Accessible coding solutions for developers and testers
- Writing accessible content for non-technical content authors

Consider how to capture and communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques. Include what didnâ€™t work, as well as what did, to avoid time being spent on approaches known to have problems.

Training is an initial investment that pays off as understanding of accessibility increases and it becomes more common practice. Increase knowledge should result in more accessible implementations first time, helping to reduce evaluation and rework costs and limit risk. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Training in not a once-off activity. The knowledge and skills of staff need to be monitored to be sure people are up-to-date as the environment and staff change.

## Create accessibility
Create your content accessible from the start of the project to reduce any rework and repairs later on. This concept is sometimes referred to as "born accessible" or "accessible by default". The earlier you evaluate a project for accessibility, the more accessible it will be at the ends. Likewise, if you have evaluated existing website/app, it makes sense to prioritise the fixes to get the largest benefit from your remediation.

### Evaluate early
- undertake research with your users before deciding on the solution
- check design and mockups before you start coding
- check the content and make sure it is written in a simple and understandable way
- check the code as each component is being built
- undertake usability testing with people with disabilities on a regular basis as well as technical WCAG testing

### Prioritize accessibility issues to address
Prioritizing can help you achieve all accessibility objectives. Some example are:
- Start with issues that are easier to fix, to help build motivation and demostrate success
- Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to support the creation on accessible content
- Prioritize visual design to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization
- De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, that are expected to be changed soon anyway
- Prioritize based on the impact an issue may have on users
- Establish priority based on the importance or frequency of access to a particular page or section

> [!NOTE]
> Including internal and external stakeholders in prioritization process. Review the situation with regularity to benefit from arising opportunities.

After identifying and prioritizing the problems, we must assign the responsibility for addressing and solving the problem to the appropriate team member with the right role and capable of understanding and solving the problem

### Accessible Procurement
Often organizations outsource some, or all, of the design and development. Many organizations decide to have standard and clauses in "requests for quotes" for design or development about the need for any deliverable they are outsourcing to be accessible. For example they may include conformance with WCAG at level AA, or go further and include also several criteria of AAA level.

In Europe and Australia, governments and many private organizations are referencing the European standard for [Accessibility requirements for ICT products and service - EN 301 549 v3.1.1 (PDF)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.01.01_60/en_301549v030101p.pdf) which incorporates WCAG. This standard is also referenced in the [EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj) and the [Australian Government Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/).


## Involve users

Web accessibility is not just about meeting a technical standard, it's about ensuring that our websites and apps are usable by everyone. The best way to ensure that is to involve people with disabilities in the design and testing of our digital services. It is best to include users as early as possible in a project, and to involve them in the initial user research before a project begins and at the following review point where possible:
- user interface designs,
- graphic designs,
- content design,
- component design,
- coded website

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Carefully consider all input. Avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities.
> A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with same disability interact with the web nor how people with other disabilities might interact.
> **Getting input from a range of users is best**.

## Monitor changes
The web is constantly changing. New technologies, new standards, new laws, and new policies are always being introduced. It is important to keep up to date with these changes and to understand how they might impact your accessibility work.

Policies and standards that your organization is conforming with can be updated. It is important to keep up to date, for example:
- WCAG are on a regular update path: WCAG 2.1 was published in 2018; WCAG 2.2 was published in 2021; WCAG 3 is in development;
- WAI-ARIA  v1.1 was release in December 2017; WAI-ARIA v1.2 was published in 2023;
- Government policies and ISO or local standards are also updated regularly. This is often to reflect updates in WCAG.

The W3C's [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) page lists laws from around the world that relate to web accessibility. 

Another important aspect, is the technology evolution. New technologies are always being introduced, and existing technologies are always being updated. It is important to understand how these changes might impact on accessibility. For example, new technologies might introduce new accessibility challenges, or they might make it easier to create accessible content. Some example are:
- voice-driven apps (ex. alexa apps)
- adoption of 'tap on glass' technologis in kiosks, ATMs, POS machines


> [!NOTE]
> Remember, teams, roles and skills also change. It is important to monitor these changes and maintain skills to stay up to date with the latest accessibility techniques and technologies.


## Continue engagement
It is important to continue to engage with both internal and external stakeholders. 

- **Internal stakeholders:** will want to know that progress continues to be made and the organizations' commitments are being met. They will also want to know about any new opportunities that arise. Overall, they may be interested in how this is impacting the business and the effects on key performance indicators.
- **External stakeholders:** will also need to be reminded of your commitment and assured that you are continuing to meet their expectations around accessibility.

Work with internal stakeholders to ensure that accessibility remains a priority, particularly when it comes to new projects. Long-term engagement should also consider how accessibility changes are impacting project delivery (costing less? less time needed to ensure accessibility? etc.. ).
