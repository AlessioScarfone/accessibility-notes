# What is web accessibility?
**Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.**
More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web contribute to the Web.
Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual
 
Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc., older people with changing abilities due to ageing people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth.

The **Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life**: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. **It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities**. Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as:

- older people
- people in rural areas
- people in developing countries
