# Discover and Plan

> From: [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/)

The first steps to achieving accessibility goals are **discover** and **plan** stage. In this stages you will:
- undestrand the current state of accessibility
- build enthusiasm for it in your organization
- create a plan develop clear goals
- start to build an environment that supports accessibility

These are composed by six activities:
- **Explore the current environment:** investigate your organizations's current state of accessibility and your legal obligations to help understand the work ahead.
- **Set objectives and allocate resources:** create objectives that align with your accessibility goals and ensure you have the necessary resources to meet them.
- **Gather support and raise awareness:** engage and gather support from stakeholders and raise awareness about your accessibility program.
- **Create your accessibility policy:** create an accessibility policy for creating, managing and delivering accessible digital content.
- **Create your accessibility statements:** create accessibility statements for websites, mobile applications or other digital content. 
- **Create a monitoring framework:** create a standard way of monitoring and reporting on progress against your accessibility goals.


## Explore your current environment
To help start discussions about accessibility, explore and learn the current  state of accessibility in your organization. 
Some specific areas to look at includes:
- **Governance**
  - What accessibility laws, policies or industry standards apply to your organization?
  - Is there an executive sponsor fo accessibility in you organization?
- **Policy**
  - How well do the existing policies and processes support accessible practices?
- **Awareness and capability**
  - What is the general awareness about accessibility in different parts of your organization?
  - What is the level of accessibility knowledge and skills in your organization? What support is available to improve the situation, such as training or mentors?
- **Assets and tools**
  - What digital content do you have (websites, intrantes, mobile apps, etc) ? What is their current level of accessiblity?
  - Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing accessibility? It is important to also understand how well authoring tools support you in creating accessible content.
  - The authoring tools used in your organization are accessible?
- **Finance**
  - What, if any, budget is being spent on accessibility?

Perform a detailed accessibility review of digital content that aligns with your objectives. This can:
- create a baseline for future work;
- identify where training or additional expertise is needed;
- help clarify how big a problem exists;
- show progess to stakeholders as you highlight existing problems and start to fix issues.

The review can highlight examples of good practice, identify staff with accessibility expertise and identify problems to avoid in the future.

If you need to quickly identify some potential issues: [Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) provide a list of simple checks that can be carried out by anyone, regardless of their level of technical skills and accessibility knowledge.

Where you want to do a comprehensive evaluation: [Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/) provides a structured approach to help evaluate websites for accessibility.

> [!NOTE]
> Accessibility checks can be perfomed at all stages of the process, not only when the website is completed

### Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)

**Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM)** is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).** It is developed by the WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology Task Force (Eval TF), which is a joint task force of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) and Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG). The Working Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

>[!WARNING]
> Applying WCAG-EM successfully requires knowledge of WCAG, accessible web design, assistive technologies, and how people with different disabilities use the Web.

WCAG-EM provides guidance on using the methodology and considerations for specific situations. The conformance evaluation procedure is detailed under 5 main steps:
1. **Define the scope of the evaluation** - defining what is included in the evaluation; the goal of the evaluation; and the WCAG conformance level (A, AA, AAA).
2. **Explore the website** - identifying key web pages; key functionality; types of web content, designs, functionality, etc.; required web technologies.
3. **Select a representative sample** - guidance on structured and randomly selected web pages when it is not feasible to evaluate every web page on a website.
4. **Evaluate/Audit the selected sample** - determining successes and failures in meeting WCAG; accessibility support for website features; and recording evaluation steps.
5. **Report the evaluation findings** - aggregating and reporting evaluation findings; making evaluation statements; and calculating overall scores.

The [WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/evaluation/define-scope) helps you follow the steps of WCAG-EM and generate a structured report from the input that you provide.

## Set objectives and allocate resources
After exploring the environment and identifying accessibility gaps, you can create measurable objectives that address these gaps within the organization's digital content, processes, and policies. Objectives helps to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables and ensure that successful delivery can be determinated.

When setting objectives, include:
- **deliverables:** what are the outcomes you want to achieve
- **timelines:** when are you going to achieve these deliverables
- **success measures:** how do you know when you've met your objective

Ensure that objectives have agreement and support from management. This will help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. Also ensure that objectives help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes.

### Secure budget and resources
Your budget and resources needs will depend on your goals and the extend of the work required to meet them. You may need to consider:
- **Accessibility evaluations:** how often they need to occur and how extensive theu need to be
- **Evaluation with people:** how will you involve users with dsabilities in evaluations
- **Reviews of policies and procedures:** how long will it take to determine which policies need to change, make the changes and implement the changes
- **Recruitment:** do you need to recruit accessibility specialists or coordinators to help you meet your accessibility goals
- **Staff training:** deliver general awareness as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities (design, development, content writing)
- **Tooling:** adoption or possible replacement of tools to support accessibility
- **Expercienced support:** external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improve

One the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval. Ensure that final budget includes how it will support you to meet your goals, and what return on investments could be expected (ex: better website performance, reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved corporate social responsibility, etc).

## Gather support and raise awareness
To achieve your accessibility goals, support needs to come from accross the organization. Support can come from different areas, form design and development teams, to management and marketing. Regular communicating with management helps you maintain long-term support.
Stakeholder and management support will simpliify the process of introducing or improve accessibility (ex: prioritizing accessibility objectives and securing resources and budget).

Support doesn't only come from internal stakeholders, it is important to engage also external stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, and partners. They can provide valuable feedback and help you understand the impact of your accessibility work.

Communicate your effort publicly to help set expectations and increase internal commitment for accessibility.


### Raise awareness about accessibility
Lack of awareness is a frequent reason for lack of accessibility adoption. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on website accessibility. Others may not be aware of the additional value that accessibility brings. A general introduction to accessibility, including organizational goals, will benefit everyone in the organization by improving awareness and building enthusiasm for the task.
Consider audience needs and interests as you raise awareness of the benefits of web accessibility. Management will need to know about risk, budget, policy, and return on investment but designers may engage with understanding and solving the design challenges of accessibility. Developers may also enjoy the challenge of making modern designs accessible. Marketing may be interested in user stories and demonstrating corporate responsibility.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Building awareness about accessibility and disability need to be a going activity, not a one-off.

## Introducing accessibility policies

A web accessibility policy is a critital document that explains an organization's commitment to accessibility and summarise its approach. It is important because it shows commitment towards the accessibility and communicates your goals and targets. It set clear expectations and defines who has responsibility for accessibility.

Policies vary across organizations but at a minimum establishes what web accessibility standard you aim to conform to and by when. For example, your policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.1 Level AA within one year. A policy may cover other topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting.

Some information we'd expecto to find in an accessibility policy:
- it should include relevant standards (es. WCAG 2 Level AA or EN 301 549);
- it should indicate what content is in scope (web site, app, documents, etc);
- it should included procurement of third party product and service whether these are paid for or free because they are part of your website;
- it should set clear milestones.

For a policy to be effective, it is important that progress against the poicy is monitored. This can be done by regular reporting, audits, and reviews. It is also important that the policy has approval and backing from management. This will help all implementation activities, ensuring that resources are available and activities are prioritized.

## Create your accessibility statements
Accessibility statements are important for several reasons:
- Show your users that you care about accessibility and about them.
- Provide them with information about the accessibility of your content.
- Demonstrate commitment to accessibility, and to social responsibility.



Accessibility statements should contain at least the following:
- A commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities.
- The accessibility standard applied, such as WCAG 2.1
- Content information in case users encounter problems

It is also advisable to include:
- Any know limitaitons, to avoid frustrating of your users
- Measures taken by your organization to ensure accessibility
- Technical prerequisites for using your website (ex. supported browser)
- Environment in which the content was tested
- References to applicable national or local laws and policies.

> [!NOTE]
> In some situations, you may be required to provide an accessibility statement, such as public bodies in countries that implement the [EU Web Accessibility Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj). Sometime you may also be asketd to provide particular content in your accessibility statement.

The statements are primarily for users of your content. Usually, they will refer to it when they encouter problems. Technical or legal language will likely lead to confusion and frustration. It is important to make the statement as clear and understandable as possible and make sure that the information is useful and relevant to your users.

> [!TIP]
> Better to say: "videos do not have captions" than "WCAG Success Criterion 1.2.2  was not met"

Accessibility statements should be easy to find and easy to understand. They should be linked from several places, such as from the footer, help menu, sitemap, about page and other prominent areas help users to find them.

### Useful resources: 
- [Developing an Accessibility Statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/)
- [Accessibility statement generator tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create): it helps you create an accessibility statement for your own website, mobile, app or digital content. You can download the generated statement and further customize style and brand.


## Create a monitoring framework

To track progress, create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings to stakeholders. Defined milestones help you measure your progress but ensure that each milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress has occurred. Some example of criteria include:
- number of WCAG success criteria passed and their level;
- number of complaints or reports received relating to accessibility;
- positive social media comements on the accessibility service;
- training sessions on accessibility delived to the staff.

For long-term or ongoing goals you need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. This will also help you to identify and address any new accessibility issues that arise.

> [!TIP]
> When goals aren't being met and issues are indetified, ask why these issue are occuring. Some questions to cosider include:
> - Are issues caused by staff members who have not had adeqate training?
> - Are they the result of a problem linked to a tool used (e.g. CMS)?
> - Are the requirements unclear?
